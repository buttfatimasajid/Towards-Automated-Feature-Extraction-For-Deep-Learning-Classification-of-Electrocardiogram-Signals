	Abstract = {Electrocardiography (ECG) is a key non-invasive diagnostic tool for cardiovascular diseases which is increasingly supported by algorithms based on machine learning. Major obstacles for the development of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms are both the lack of public datasets and well-defined benchmarking procedures to allow comparison s of different algorithms. To address these issues, we put forward PTB-XL, the to-date largest freely accessible clinical 12-lead ECG-waveform dataset comprising 21837 records from 18885 patients of 10 seconds length. The ECG-waveform data was annotated by up to two cardiologists as a multi-label dataset, where diagnostic labels were further aggregated into super and subclasses. The dataset covers a broad range of diagnostic classes including, in particular, a large fraction of healthy records. The combination with additional metadata on demographics, additional diagnostic statements, diagnosis likelihoods, manually annotated signal properties as well as suggested folds for splitting training and test sets turns the dataset into a rich resource for the development and the evaluation of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms.},

ABSTRACT={Machine learning (ML) proposes an extensive range of techniques, which could be applied to forecasting soil movements using historical soil movements and other variables. For example, researchers have proposed recurrent ML techniques like the long short-term memory (LSTM) models for forecasting time series variables. However, the application of novel LSTM models for forecasting time series involving soil movements is yet to be fully explored. The primary objective of this research is to develop and test a new ensemble LSTM technique (called “Bidirectional-Stacked-LSTM” or “BS-LSTM”). In the BS-LSTM model, forecasts of soil movements are derived from a bidirectional LSTM for a period. These forecasts are then fed into a stacked LSTM to derive the next period’s forecast. For developing the BS-LSTM model, datasets from two real-world landslide sites in India were used: Tangni (Chamoli district) and Kumarhatti (Solan district). The initial 80\% of soil movements in both datasets were used for model training and the last 20\% of soil movements in both datasets were used for model testing. The BS-LSTM model’s performance was compared to other LSTM variants, including a simple LSTM, a bidirectional LSTM, a stacked LSTM, a CNN-LSTM, and a Conv-LSTM, on both datasets. Results showed that the BS-LSTM model outperformed all other LSTM model variants during training and test in both the Tangni and Kumarhatti datasets. This research highlights the utility of developing recurrent ensemble models for forecasting soil movements ahead of time.}

abstract="Myocardial infarction is the leading cause of death worldwide. In this paper, we design domain-inspired neural network models to detect myocardial infarction. First, we study the contribution of various leads. This systematic analysis, first of its kind in the literature, indicates that out of 15 ECG leads, data from the v6, vz, and ii leads are critical to correctly identify myocardial infarction. Second, we use this finding and adapt the ConvNetQuake neural network model---originally designed to identify earthquakes---to attain state-of-the-art classification results for myocardial infarction, achieving 99.43{\%} classification accuracy on a record-wise split, and 97.83{\%} classification accuracy on a patient-wise split. These two results represent cardiologist-level performance level for myocardial infarction detection after feeding only 10 s of raw ECG data into our model. Third, we show that our multi-ECG-channel neural network achieves cardiologist-level performance without the need of any kind of manual feature extraction or data pre-processing.",

	Abstract = {Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a special type of Neural Networks, which has shown exemplary performance on several competitions related to Computer Vision and Image Processing. Some of the exciting application areas of CNN include Image Classification and Segmentation, Object Detection, Video Processing, Natural Language Processing, and Speech Recognition. The powerful learning ability of deep CNN is primarily due to the use of multiple feature extraction stages that can automatically learn representations from the data. The availability of a large amount of data and improvement in the hardware technology has accelerated the research in CNNs, and recently interesting deep CNN architectures have been reported. Several inspiring ideas to bring advancements in CNNs have been explored, such as the use of different activation and loss functions, parameter optimization, regularization, and architectural innovations. However, the significant improvement in the representational capacity of the deep CNN is achieved through architectural innovations. Notably, the ideas of exploiting spatial and channel information, depth and width of architecture, and multi-path information processing have gained substantial attention. Similarly, the idea of using a block of layers as a structural unit is also gaining popularity. This survey thus focuses on the intrinsic taxonomy present in the recently reported deep CNN architectures and, consequently, classifies the recent innovations in CNN architectures into seven different categories. These seven categories are based on spatial exploitation, depth, multi-path, width, feature-map exploitation, channel boosting, and attention. Additionally, the elementary understanding of CNN components, current challenges, and applications of CNN are also provided.},

This study considers various types of the DL methods such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Deep Belief Network (DBN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).

ABSTRACT = {Early detection of arrhythmia and effective treatment can prevent deaths caused by cardiovascular disease (CVD). In clinical practice, the diagnosis is made by checking the electrocardiogram (ECG) beat-by-beat, but this is usually time-consuming and laborious. In the paper, we propose an automatic ECG classification method based on Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CWT is used to decompose ECG signals to obtain different time-frequency components, and CNN is used to extract features from the 2D-scalogram composed of the above time-frequency components. Considering the surrounding R peak interval (also called RR interval) is also useful for the diagnosis of arrhythmia, four RR interval features are extracted and combined with the CNN features to input into a fully connected layer for ECG classification. By testing in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, our method achieves an overall performance of 70.75%, 67.47%, 68.76%, and 98.74% for positive predictive value, sensitivity, F1-score, and accuracy, respectively. Compared with existing methods, the overall F1-score of our method is increased by 4.75~16.85%. Because our method is simple and highly accurate, it can potentially be used as a clinical auxiliary diagnostic tool.},

abstract = {The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a useful diagnostic tool to diagnose various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as myocardial infarction (MI). The ECG records the heart's electrical activity and these signals are able to reflect the abnormal activity of the heart. However, it is challenging to visually interpret the ECG signals due to its small amplitude and duration. Therefore, we propose a novel approach to automatically detect the MI using ECG signals. In this study, we implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm for the automated detection of a normal and MI ECG beats (with noise and without noise). We achieved an average accuracy of 93.53\% and 95.22\% using ECG beats with noise and without noise removal respectively. Further, no feature extraction or selection is performed in this work. Hence, our proposed algorithm can accurately detect the unknown ECG signals even with noise. So, this system can be introduced in clinical settings to aid the clinicians in the diagnosis of MI.}
